# Extractors
This folder contains configuration extractors which can be ran both as standalone scripts as well as through [Karton's configuration extractor].
> [!CAUTION]
> The scripts in these repositories rely on [features which have not yet been merged upstream](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/malduck/pull/115). While this is accounted for in `requirements.txt`, Docker images such as those for [Karton's configuration extractor] will need to include these changes as well.
